## Technologies

The project is built using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and split into two modules, the client and server.

**Client (built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)):**

-   [React](https://react.dev/)
-   [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)
-   [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
-   [axios](https://axios-http.com/)

**Server (built with [esno](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esno)):**

-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) connected by [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [Express File Routing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-file-routing)
-   [Joi](https://joi.dev/)
-   [bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
-   [http-status-codes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-status-codes)
-   [nodemailer](https://www.nodemailer.com/)
-   [JWT](https://jwt.io/)

**Development Utilities:**

-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent code formatting, see `.prettierrc`.
-   [morgan](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/morgan.html) for request logging
-   [picocolors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picocolors) for adding colour to request logging

## Environment Variables

Both the server and client utilize a `.env` file.

```
|.
├── client/
│   └── .env -- client environment variables (injected by Vite)
└── server/
    └── .env -- server environment variables (injected by dotenv)
```

**Client Variables:**

| Key  | Usage                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| PORT | Port used for the frontend app |

**Server Variables:**

| Key        | Usage                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PORT       | Port used for the express server              |
| MONGO_URL  | The MongoDB connection string                 |
| JWT_TTL    | The JWT token expiry time, in seconds         |
| JWT_SECRET | The secret used to sign and verify JWT tokens |

## Running Locally & Deployment

During development, both the client and server use the command `npm run dev` to launch the development server with file watching.

The client compiles to a `dist` folder with the command `npm run build`. This folder can be deployed as is. The command `npm start` will first build and then preview the build with vite.

The server does not compile, esno is used in watch mode during development (`npm run dev`), and in static mode during deployment. The whole project must be deployed and started with `npm start`.
