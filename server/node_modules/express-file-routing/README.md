# express-file-routing

![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/matthiaaas/express-file-routing?color=brightgreen&label=latest)

Flexible system-based file routing for Express with `0` dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
npm install express-file-routing
```

**Note:** If you prefer `yarn` instead of `npm`, just use `yarn add express-file-routing`.

## How to use

Fundamentally, there are two ways of adding this library to your codebase: either as a middleware `app.use("/", await router())`, which will add a separate [mini-router](http://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#router) to your app, or by wrapping your whole Express instance with a `await createRouter(app)`, which will bind the routes directly to your app. In most cases, it doesn't matter on what option you decide, even though one or the other might perform better in some scenarios.

- app.ts (main)

```ts
import express from "express"
import createRouter, { router } from "express-file-routing"

const app = express()

// Option 1
app.use("/", await router()) // as router middleware or

// Option 2
await createRouter(app) // as wrapper function

app.listen(2000)
```

**Note:** It uses your project's `/routes` directory as source by default.

- routes/index.ts

```ts
export const get = async (req, res) => {
  if (req.method !== "GET") return res.status(405)

  return res.json({ hello: "world" })
}
```

#### Directory Structure

Files inside your project's `/routes` directory will get matched an url path automatically.

```php
├── app.ts
├── routes
    ├── index.ts // index routes
    ├── posts
        ├── index.ts
        └── [id].ts or :id.ts // dynamic params
    └── users.ts
└── package.json
```

- `/routes/index.ts` → /
- `/routes/posts/index.ts` → /posts
- `/routes/posts/[id].ts` → /posts/:id
- `/routes/users.ts` → /users

**Note:** Files prefixed with an underscore or ending with `.d.ts` are excluded from route generation.

## API

```ts
await createRouter(app, {
  directory: path.join(__dirname, "routes"),
  additionalMethods: ["ws", ...]
})
// or
app.use("/", await router({
  directory: path.join(__dirname, "routes"),
  additionalMethods: ["ws", ...],
  routerOptions: express.RouterOptions
}))
```

### Options

- `directory`: The path to the routes directory (defaults to `/routes`)
- `additionalMethods`: Additional methods that match an export from a route like `ws` (e.g. `ws` for express-ws)
- `routerOptions`: Native Express [Router Options](https://expressjs.com/de/api.html#express.router) objects forwarded as-is to the underlying router

## Examples

### HTTP Method Matching

If you export functions named e.g. `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`/`del` [etc.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) from a route file, those will get matched their corresponding http method automatically.

```ts
export const get = async (req, res) => { ... }

export const post = async (req, res) => { ... }

// since it's not allowed to name constants 'delete', try 'del' instead
export const del = async (req, res) => { ... }

// you can still use a wildcard default export in addition
export default async (req, res) => { ... }
```

**Note:** Named method exports gain priority over wildcard exports (= default exports).

### Middlewares

You can add isolated, route specific middlewares by exporting an array of Express request handlers from your route file.

```ts
// routes/dashboard
import { rateLimit, bearerToken, userAuth } from "../middlewares"

export const get = [
  rateLimit(), bearerToken(), userAuth(),
  async (req, res) => { ... }
]
```

A middleware function might look like the following:

```ts
// middlewares/userAuth.ts
export default (options) => async (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.authenticated) next()
  ...
}
```

### Custom Methods Exports

You can add support for other method exports to your route files. This means that if your root app instance accepts non built-in handler invocations like `app.ws(route, handler)`, you can make them being recognized as valid handlers.

```ts
// app.ts
import ws from "express-ws"

const { app } = ws(express())

await createRouter(app, {
  additionalMethods: ["ws"]
})

// routes/index.ts
export const ws = async (ws, req) => {
  ws.send("hello world")
}
```

### Usage with TypeScript

Adding support for route & method handler type definitions is as straightforward as including Express' native `Handler` type from [@types/express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/express).

```ts
// routes/posts.ts
import type { Handler } from "express"

export const get: Handler = async (req, res, next) => { ... }
```

### Error Handling

It is essential to catch potential errors (500s, 404s etc.) within your route handlers and forward them through `next(err)` if necessary, as treated in the Express' docs on [error handling](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html).

Defining custom error-handling middleware functions should happen _after_ applying your file-system routes.

```ts
app.use("/", await router()) // or await createRouter(app)

app.use(async (err, req, res, next) => {
  ...
})
```

### Catch-All (unstable)

This library lets you extend dynamic routes to catch-all routes by prefixing it with three dots `...` inside the brackets. This will make that route match itself but also all subsequent routes within that route.

**Note:** Since this feature got added recently, it might be unstable. Feedback is welcome.

```ts
// routes/users/[...catchall].js
export const get = async (req, res) => {
  return res.json({ path: req.params[0] })
}
```

- `routes/users/[...catchall].js` matches /users/a, /users/a/b and so on, but **not** /users.

## Migrating from v2

The latest version v3 fixed stable support for ESM & CJS compatibility. But also **introduced a breaking change** in the library's API. To upgrade, first install the latest version from npm.

### Upgrade version

```
npm install express-file-routing@latest
```

### Await the router

Registering the file-router in v2 was synchronous. Newer versions require you to await the router. So the only change in your codebase will be to await the router instead of calling it synchronously:

```diff
const app = express()

- app.use(router())
+ app.use(await router())

app.listen(2000)
```

Or if you were using `createRouter()`:

```diff
const app = express()

- createRouter(app)
+ await createRouter(app)

app.listen(2000)
```

**Note:** If you environment does not support top-level await, you might need to wrap you code in an async function.
